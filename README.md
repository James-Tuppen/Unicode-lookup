# Unicode lookup
### I honestly would not recommend using this as a learning resource, just as a quick tool
This is a "smart" Python Unicode character lookup script. You run it, type something to do with the character in the console, and it spits out some things you might be looking for. I made this many years ago, just to learn a bit of Unicode-python stuff, therefore the code is horrendous. You can lookup by name, the character itself, its number (or hex code), ect. Just thought I would make this public so people could use it.


Made in Python 3.6, tested basically not at all. Definitely wonâ€™t be updated, unless I randomly want it to work properly again. If I wanted it to work well, I would probably have to re-write most of it.
